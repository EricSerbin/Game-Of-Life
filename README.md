# Game-Of-Life
An interpretation of Conway's Game of Life created in Unity

There is a slider under mapdata that works for controller both the height and width inside the inspector. The clear cells button will clear all cells,
 the randomize button will randomize every cell based on 50/50 odds. The pause button will pause the game in between a loop of checking the cell
neighbors, calculating the next cell, and updating colors. The game speed will reset to 1x after unpausing. The speed may be modified by clicking the speed++ or speed-- buttons. Existing living cells are green, while newborn cells are a dark blue.
